About the Project -
<br>
Its a Combination of Multiple deep learning models to identify the difference between deepfake and real videos.

Audio Testing model - test the spectographic image of the audio signal. Use CNN layer on the imgaes obtained from the audio files.
Video Testing models - 3 models 
                        1. CNN Model - used to test difference between the frames of videos whether they are deepfaked or not.
                        2. LSTM&RNN Model - Used to pick up iregularities in the motion video, i.e. different frames.
                        3. GAN Model - Used to check whether image has been created from any deepfake generator.
