#DeepFake Video Detction Project

**About the Project -**
<br/>
Its a Combination of Multiple deep learning models to identify the difference between deepfake and real videos. <br/><br/>

Audio Testing model - test the spectographic image of the audio signal. Use CNN layer on the imgaes obtained from the audio files. <br/>
Video Testing models - 3 models <br/>
                        <tr/><tr/>1. CNN Model - used to test difference between the frames of videos whether they are deepfaked or not.<br/>
                        <tr/><tr/>2. LSTM&RNN Model - Used to pick up iregularities in the motion video, i.e. different frames.<br/>
                        <tr/><tr/>3. GAN Model - Used to check whether image has been created from any deepfake generator.<br/>
